## 🧾 Short Bio

My name is Syed Ahmed Salik, and I am a passionate learner from Karachi, Pakistan. I have completed my Intermediate in Computer Science and have recently begun my graduation at Ilma University. Alongside my academic studies, I am actively pursuing professional skills in the tech field to build a strong foundation for my future.

Currently, I am enrolled in the Web and App Development program offered by Saylani Mass IT Training, where I am learning full-stack development. Prior to this, I completed a comprehensive course in Digital Marketing from the same institute and have earned certification in that field. These skills have helped me grow in both technical and creative aspects of the digital world.

Apart from modern education, I am also committed to Islamic education. I have been pursuing Dars-e-Nizami, an 8-year Islamic course. I have successfully completed 5 years and, In Shaa Allah, after the next 3 years, I will earn a Double Master's Degree in Islamic Studies. This balance between worldly and religious education is very important to me.

In addition to studying, I also work as a school teacher and offer home tuition. I believe strongly in self-learning and consistently try to improve my knowledge and skills through various resources. My ultimate goal is to become a skilled and impactful developer, contributing to both technology and society in meaningful ways.
